## 📚 Getting Started

This repository is self‑contained and vendors the shared `injective-ui` layer, so you can run it without fetching external layers.

### Prerequisites

#### 1. Install Node.js 20 LTS

**First, check if you already have Node.js:**
```bash
node --version
```

If you see a version number starting with `v20.x.x`, you're good! Skip to step 2.

If you see `command not found` or a different version, install Node.js 20 using one of these methods:

<details>
<summary><strong>Method 1: Direct Download (easiest for beginners)</strong></summary>

1. Visit [nodejs.org/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Download the **LTS version 20.x** installer for your operating system:
   - **macOS:** Download the `.pkg` file and run it
   - **Windows:** Download the `.msi` file and run it
   - **Linux:** Use your package manager or download the binary
3. Follow the installation wizard (accept defaults)
4. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   node --version
   # Should output: v20.x.x
   ```
   ```bash
   npm --version
   # Should output: 10.x.x (npm comes with Node.js)
   ```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Method 2: Using nvm (recommended for developers - macOS/Linux)</strong></summary>

nvm lets you easily switch between Node.js versions.

1. Install nvm:
   ```bash
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
   ```
2. Close and reopen your terminal, then run:
   ```bash
   nvm install 20
   nvm use 20
   ```
3. Verify:
   ```bash
   node --version
   # Should output: v20.x.x
   ```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Method 3: Using asdf (for multi-language version management)</strong></summary>

```bash
# Install asdf first if you don't have it
git clone https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf.git ~/.asdf --branch v0.14.0

# Add to your shell profile (~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, etc.)
echo '. "$HOME/.asdf/asdf.sh"' >> ~/.zshrc

# Restart terminal, then install Node.js
asdf plugin add nodejs
asdf install nodejs 20
asdf local nodejs 20
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Method 4: Using Volta (cross-platform version manager)</strong></summary>

```bash
# Install Volta
curl https://get.volta.sh | bash

# Restart terminal, then install Node.js
volta install node@20
```

</details>

#### 2. Install Yarn Classic (v1.22.22)

**First, check if you already have Yarn:**
```bash
yarn --version
```

If you see a version starting with `1.x.x`, you're good! Skip to Installation.

If you see `command not found` or version `2.x`/`3.x`/`4.x`, install Yarn Classic:

<details>
<summary><strong>Method 1: Using Corepack (recommended - built into Node.js 16.9+)</strong></summary>

```bash
# Enable Corepack
corepack enable

# Install Yarn 1.22.22
corepack prepare yarn@1.22.22 --activate

# Verify
yarn --version
# Should output: 1.22.22
```

> **Note:** If `corepack enable` fails with permission errors, try `sudo corepack enable` (macOS/Linux) or run as Administrator (Windows).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Method 2: Using npm (if Corepack doesn't work)</strong></summary>

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g yarn@1.22.22

# Verify
yarn --version
# Should output: 1.22.22
```

> **Note:** If you get permission errors on macOS/Linux, try `sudo npm install -g yarn@1.22.22`

</details>

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:InjectiveLabs/pdaas.git
cd pdaas
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

> **Note:** If you get `yarn: command not found`, go back to the Prerequisites section above and install Yarn.

3. Copy environment variables template and configure for local development

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and set your configuration. The vendored `injective-ui` layer is used by default (`LOCAL_LAYER=true`).

4. Run the app locally

```bash
yarn dev
```

The dev server will start on `http://127.0.0.1:3000` (configurable via `PORT` and `HOST` in `.env`).

**Notes:**
- By default, the app uses the **vendored** `injective-ui` layer from this repo (faster, offline-capable).
- To use the **remote** layer from GitHub instead, set `LOCAL_LAYER=false` in `.env` or run `yarn dev:remote`.
- For security, the dev server binds to `127.0.0.1` (localhost-only). Use `HOST=0.0.0.0` in `.env` if you need network access.

## 📖 Documentation

This project is built using Nuxt and TailwindCSS and is powered by the [injective-ts monorepo](https://github.com/InjectiveLabs/injective-ts/). It vendors the shared `injective-ui` layer for a smooth, self‑contained local development experience while retaining upstream Injective compatibility.

You can run the app locally without having to set up a relayer. Use the `public` network in your `VITE_NETWORK` `.env` configuration variable and run `yarn dev`. You can find available networks (predefined endpoint sets) [here](https://github.com/InjectiveLabs/injective-ts/blob/17b1aa5df39d5724baf6262b276980cf722a1cba/packages/networks/src/types.ts#L1). Using these endpoints (from the `public` network) gives 40% of trading fees to the community spend pool. Once you set up private endpoints, you can redirect that 40% to any address you wish.

### Deployment

You can deploy this Nuxt 3 app using your preferred provider (Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, or AWS S3/CloudFront). For static sites, use `yarn generate`; for server rendering, use `nuxi build` and your platform's adapter.

See the official Nuxt docs for deployment guides.

### Nuxt3

This project runs on Nuxt 3. You shouldn’t need any migration steps; just follow the Getting Started section above.
