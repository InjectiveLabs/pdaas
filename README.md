## 📚 Getting Started

This repository is self‑contained and vendors the shared `injective-ui` layer, so you can run it without fetching external layers.

> Prerequisites
>
> - Node 20 LTS
>   - nvm: `nvm install 20 && nvm use 20` (auto‑selected via `.nvmrc`)
>   - asdf: `asdf install` (reads `.tool-versions`/`.node-version`), then `asdf local nodejs 20`
>   - Volta: `curl https://get.volta.sh | bash && volta install node@20`
> - Yarn Classic (v1)
>   - Using Corepack (recommended): `corepack enable && corepack prepare yarn@1.22.22 --activate`
>   - Or install globally: `npm i -g yarn@1.22.22`

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:InjectiveLabs/pdaas.git
cd pdaas
yarn
```

2. Optional: copy environment variables template and adjust values

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Run the app locally (uses the vendored Injective UI layer)

```bash
LOCAL_LAYER=true PORT=3000 HOST=0.0.0.0 yarn dev
```

Notes:
- `LOCAL_LAYER=true` forces Nuxt to use the vendored `injective-ui` layer in this repo instead of fetching `github:InjectiveLabs/injective-ui/layer#master`.
- You can omit `PORT`/`HOST` if you prefer defaults; they are shown here to bind on `http://localhost:3000`.
- If you previously saw “Cannot extend config from github:InjectiveLabs/injective-ui/layer#master”, ensure `LOCAL_LAYER=true` is set when running locally.

## 📖 Documentation

This project is built using Nuxt and TailwindCSS and is powered by the [injective-ts monorepo](https://github.com/InjectiveLabs/injective-ts/). It vendors the shared `injective-ui` layer for a smooth, self‑contained local development experience while retaining upstream Injective compatibility.

You can run the app locally without having to set up a relayer. Use the `public` network in your `VITE_NETWORK` `.env` configuration variable and run `yarn dev`. You can find available networks (predefined endpoint sets) [here](https://github.com/InjectiveLabs/injective-ts/blob/17b1aa5df39d5724baf6262b276980cf722a1cba/packages/networks/src/types.ts#L1). Using these endpoints (from the `public` network) gives 40% of trading fees to the community spend pool. Once you set up private endpoints, you can redirect that 40% to any address you wish.

### Deployment

You can deploy this Nuxt 3 app using your preferred provider (Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, or AWS S3/CloudFront). For static sites, use `yarn generate`; for server rendering, use `nuxi build` and your platform's adapter.

See the official Nuxt docs for deployment guides.

### Nuxt3

This project runs on Nuxt 3. You shouldn’t need any migration steps; just follow the Getting Started section above.
